Problem statement:
Craft a program in Python which has the features listed below: 1. 2. 3. 4. You program should use the input() function that includes message text to instruct the user to enter each student’s data. Use an appropriate data structure to create and store this data, which contains the student’s ID or Name, and overall score. Your program calculates the overall rate using the four main criteria described above (Coursework 1, Coursework 2, Coursework 3 and Test) Your program should estimate the suitable category for the student by using the category dataset provided above. For instance, if the overall score of the student is 73.3, the output should be: Student’s ID/Name 72 - First 5. The computed score should be printed out as an integer (no decimals).

Task 2: Write a brief reflection on your code (~500 words), which may include but not limited to the discussions about topics below.

(i) How did you decompose the problem and why?
(Ans): I did break the problem into smaller problems (sub problems), this helped me view the problem as an easily accomplish-able task instead of seeing a massive wall of complexity. After doing this, I then proceeded to drafting a Pseudo-code for deeper insight and clarity. I then proceeded to the key part of any programming problem/challenge which is planning. The strategy I adopted here was to solve the easiest sub problems first then walk my way up to the ones i deemed though. This enabled me build confidence as I approached the most daunting tasks (or so i felt).

(ii) Do you think flowchart helpful when you write a program and why?
(Ans) The role of flowchart in programming certainly can not be overemphasized as it helps with proper planning and code structuring. However, for this problem I used pseudocode in place of flowchart for the under listed reasons:
 Detailed implementation: pseudocode is better for a more detailed step by step implementation. Flowchart on the other hand provides a quick overview on the prerequisite steps to take. 
 Flexibility: you can easily make changes to your pseudocode to include key points which might have been missed earlier. This would help save time as there would be no need to reconstruct a visual flowchart.  
The presence of user inputs and calculations: this is another reason why pseudocode is a better fit for this task. These type of actions are better expressed in pseudocode.

(iii) Have you met any difficulties/bugs during this coursework, and how did you tackle it?
(Ans) As a programmer, I understand that writing and debugging codes are two sides of the same coin. In other words it is almost a certainty that you will encounter bugs as you write your code. I did use the following strategies to debug my code.  
Google: it is general knowledge that there is no coding challenge you encounter that has not been encountered before. So researched the problem and possible reasons why the problems occurred.  
Stack overflow: The stack overflow community is one made of highly experienced developers who would help guide you on the necessary steps to debugging your code yourself. 
Taking breaks occasionally: the process of converting pseudocode to proper python syntax which the system understands certainly can be overwhelming. So whenever I felt overwhelmed, i simply took a break then revisited the problem. I was actually shocked to realize how much more clarity i got just by taking a brief break.

(iv) What did you think is the most difficult part in this coursework?
(Ans) The most difficult part of this project/coursework was writing the code that summed the value of each coursework and test score then returned the student's average score. I would say about 33% of the total time spent on writing the code was vested in this particular block code section. I spent time doing research for this and tapping from the experience of developers ahead of myself via community forums like stack overflow.

(v) What have you learnt from investigating this problem?
(Ans) I make bold to say without missing words that this problem did teach me certain pivotal skills which are listed below: 
Divide and conquer: I did learn the key role divide and conquer plays in problem solving. This task thought me how important it is to break a major/big problem into smaller problems then proffer solutions to them  
How to conduct proper research: researching is a pivotal life skill everyone must have regardless of your profession. This project certainly helped me refine that skill by teaching me how to go about the acquisition of specific project requirements and how to apply them after their acquisition.  
Effective planning: I did learn how to take a task from just an idea to actualization.  
Patience: I probably did not think much of the term "patience is a virtue until I was confronted with this task. I did realize that in-spite of ones willingness to get things done in record time, sometimes we just have to wait(while working in the background) till everything aligns.

(vi) Which part(s) in your code design is your favorite and why?
(Ans) I would not say this part or that part is the favorite part of my code. This is because I did view the entire process as an avenue to learn and improve my coding abilities. I believe the major reasons we are given projects is to improve our coding and planning capabilities so to loving a particular area of your code more would eventually make me look for ways to subconsciously want to inculcate that code block in my future codes and when the project does not require it, I might get frustrated and view the new task as  difficult without knowing why.

(vii) If you had no time limit, how would you improve your program?
(Ans)If I had the luxury of time, I would certainly improve the program. I would achieve this by spending time with more advanced developers who would further enlighten me on the prerequisite steps needed to further make the program more scalable.
